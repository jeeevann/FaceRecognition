Step 1: When you DELETE a student
   - Delete from database (MySQL/PHP admin panel)
   - Delete their image folder (students/Department/Year/Division/Name/)
   
Step 2: Run training script
   $ python train.py
   
Step 3: What happens:
   ‚úì Script loads current students from database
   ‚úì Compares with old encodings
   ‚úì Detects deleted students
   ‚úì Rebuilds encodings WITHOUT deleted students
   ‚úì Shows summary of changes

Step 4: Result
   ‚úì Deleted students will NOT be recognized anymore
   ‚úì Only current students remain in encodings.pkl
   ‚úì System stays synchronized with database
